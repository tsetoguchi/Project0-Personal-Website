Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

index.html is the main page of my website, it contains a list containing different aspects of my interest in music. It also contains a table with some images (Sakurajima.jpg, Car.jpg, and Mountains.jpg) that I took in Japan last month - June 2018.
Production.html is a page that showcases some of my favorite non native VST plugins (software that integrates synthesizers and effects into digital audio workstations). On this page, I used a table to display the following: name of the VST, company the VST is made by, a short personal description, and the price in USD. I also embedded a currency converter for non-American visitors.
Songs.html utilizes multiple rows and columns from Bootstrap's grid model to parade some of my favorite songs through embedded Youtube videos and a embedded Spotify playlist.
songWriting.html also uses bootstrap in a similar manner to that of Songs.html, to help create a page filled with resources from notable pop song writers, artists, and producers talking about some of their work.
Style.css contains most of the styling that is used throughout each page, it contains IDs, classes, media queries, and divs.
bodytextimages.css is a css file that is compiled from bodytextimages.scss through sass.
